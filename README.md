In this assignment, I experimented with the basics of setting up and deploying Flask to both local and remote environments (in this case, GCP and Azure) for testing purposes. During the project, I gained hands-on experience in configuring and deploying a Flask application to different platforms and learned how to troubleshoot any issues that arise during the process. I also became familiar with the process of setting up and deploying applications to cloud platforms and how to utilize their services for hosting and scaling the application. Overall, this assignment provided me with a foundational understanding of Flask deployment and cloud computing.
